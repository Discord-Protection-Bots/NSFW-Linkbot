     Invite Link 1 - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1180169543130300557&permissions=17600776022016&scope=bot 
       Allows the following permissions - 
          - Manage Events
          - Create Events
          - Send Messages
          - Manage Messages
          - Attach Files
Invite Link 2 - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1180169543130300557&permissions=17600776153088&scope=bot

          - Send Messages
          - Manage Messages
          - Attach Files
          - Mention @Everyone (This is only needed if you want the bot to ping everyone when a link is dropped that everyone can use

Invite Link 2 - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1180169543130300557&permissions=0&scope=bot
